Next Steps
=============
✅ Define the Block-Based System – What kind of blocks do you want? (I/O, Conditional Logic, Timers, Sensors, Actuators?)
✅ Build Firmware Architecture – A modular setup where hardware configurations get interpreted into Node-RED-like visual programming.
✅ Web Interface Development – Design the GUI for drag-and-drop programming in the browser, syncing with the hardware over WebSockets/MQTT.

🔹 Architecting the Firmware
We need a modular firmware with dynamic program loading, allowing seamless switching between projects.
🔹 GUI Design & Program Selection
Design a dashboard interface where users can select & execute different control algorithms—much like industrial PLC software.
🔹 Hardware Expansion Planning
Ensure power efficiency, communication protocols, and robust driver support for your future updates.
